# TodoApp
Although this is a simple todo-app, it combines the use of front-end and back-end skills to fully connect browser, server and database. I used html, CSS and JavaScript for the front-end, Node.js for the server side and MongoDB for the database. This app is fully responsive and has cross browser compatibility.
